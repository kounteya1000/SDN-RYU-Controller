1. Always remember the password: press your spacebar five times.

2. Now we will do testing:

3. To test Mininet, open your terminal and type "sudo mn"
---------------------------------------------------------

4. It will start a simple topology with two hosts and one switch.

5. Now, type "pingall" (you will find it's pinging with all the hosts)

6. Now, exit from the terminal by typing "exit"


7. Now, we will test Wireshark
------------------------------

8. Please open your terminal and press "sudo wireshark"

9. It will start Wireshark where we can trace network packets.


10. Now, we will test Ryu SDN Controller
-----------------------------------------

11. Again, in the terminal type "ryu-manager"

12. If it shows any error that means Ryu is not installed or it will show: 
                                                                        loading app ryu.controller.ofp_handler
                                                                        instantiating app ryu.controller.ofp_handler of OFPHandler

13. So we have verified all the installed software.

14. Enjoy exploring SDN (Software-Defined Networking)

15. Thank you!
